# Thinkful_Flashcards
Flashcard app made with React 
It allows you to study the old fashioned with flashcards but in a UI from your browser window. It allows you to create custom decks with custom cards, front and
back and stores them in a local database to use whenever you want. Once you make a deck you can flip through them by clicking on them and simulating the exact
same type of study as actually flipping through notecards but without wasting the paper.
